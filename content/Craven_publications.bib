	abstract = {Secondary forests are a major terrestrial carbon sink and reliable estimates of their carbon stocks are pivotal for understanding the global carbon balance and initiatives to mitigate {CO}2 emissions through forest management and reforestation. A common method to quantify carbon stocks in forests is the use of allometric regression models to convert forest inventory data to estimates of aboveground biomass ({AGB}). The use of allometric models implies decisions on the selection of extant models or the development of a local model, the predictor variables included in the selected model, and the number of trees and species for destructive biomass measurements. We assess uncertainties associated with these decisions using data from 94 secondary forest plots in central Panama and 244 harvested trees belonging to 26 locally abundant species. {AGB} estimates from species-specific models were used to assess relative errors of estimates from multispecies models. To reduce uncertainty in the estimation of plot {AGB}, including wood specific gravity ({WSG}) in the model was more important than the number of trees used for model fitting. However, decreasing the number of trees increased uncertainty of landscape-level {AGB} estimates substantially, while including {WSG} had limited effects on the accuracy of the landscape-level estimates. Predictions of stand and landscape {AGB} varied strongly among models, making model choice an important source of uncertainty. Local models provided more accurate {AGB} estimates than foreign models, but high variability in carbon stocks across the landscape implies that developing local models is only justified when landscape sampling is sufficiently intensive.},

	abstract = {Global change drivers are rapidly altering resource availability and biodiversity. While there is consensus that greater biodiversity increases the functioning of ecosystems, the extent to which biodiversity buffers ecosystem productivity in response to changes in resource availability remains unclear. We use data from 16 grassland experiments across North America and Europe that manipulated plant species richness and one of two essential resources—soil nutrients or water—to assess the direction and strength of the interaction between plant diversity and resource alteration on above-ground productivity and net biodiversity, complementarity, and selection effects. Despite strong increases in productivity with nutrient addition and decreases in productivity with drought, we found that resource alterations did not alter biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships. Our results suggest that these relationships are largely determined by increases in complementarity effects along plant species richness gradients. Although nutrient addition reduced complementarity effects at high diversity, this appears to be due to high biomass in monocultures under nutrient enrichment. Our results indicate that diversity and the complementarity of species are important regulators of grassland ecosystem productivity, regardless of changes in other drivers of ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {Forests contribute a significant portion of the land carbon sink, but their ability to sequester {CO}2 may be constrained by nitrogen, a major plant-limiting nutrient. Many tropical forests possess tree species capable of fixing atmospheric dinitrogen (N2), but it is unclear whether this functional group can supply the nitrogen needed as forests recover from disturbance or previous land use, or expand in response to rising {CO}2 (refs 6, 8). Here we identify a powerful feedback mechanism in which N2 fixation can overcome ecosystem-scale deficiencies in nitrogen that emerge during periods of rapid biomass accumulation in tropical forests. Over a 300-year chronosequence in Panama, N2-fixing tree species accumulated carbon up to nine times faster per individual than their non-fixing neighbours (greatest difference in youngest forests), and showed species-specific differences in the amount and timing of fixation. As a result of fast growth and high fixation, fixers provided a large fraction of the nitrogen needed to support net forest growth (50,000 kg carbon per hectare) in the first 12 years. A key element of ecosystem functional diversity was ensured by the presence of different N2-fixing tree species across the entire forest age sequence. These findings show that symbiotic N2 fixation can have a central role in nitrogen cycling during tropical forest stand development, with potentially important implications for the ability of tropical forests to sequester {CO}2.},

Most plantations in humid tropical regions are established in pure plots, including few species of high commercial value, generally exotics. The present study compares growth and economic viability of 15–16\&nbsp;year-old trees of native species in pure and mixed plantations on degraded pasturelands at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. The species with the best growth were Vochysia guatemalensis, Virola koschnyi, Jacaranda copaia, Terminalia amazonia, and Hieronyma alchorneoides. The mixed plantations performed better than pure plantations for all growth variables considered, including height, diameter at breast height, volume, and aboveground biomass. Mixed plantations outperformed pure plantations economically, with Net Present Value ({NPV}) of \$1,124 to \$8,155/ha and Internal Rate of Return ({IRR}) of 7.7–15.6\% depending on the species mixture. The most profitable pure plantations were those of Vochysia guatemalensis, with {NPV} and {IRR} of \$6,035/ha and 14.3\%, respectively; Hieronyma alchorneoides (\$2,654 and 10.8\%); and Virola koschnyi (\$1,906/ha and 9.22\%). These are the estimated benefits that would be accrued at harvest. These projections are realistic since the decision to harvest is generally mandated not just by profit maximization but by economic necessity, thus many small- to medium-scale farmers in Costa Rica harvest plantations prior to the completion of the rotation length. Mixed plantation may be the preferred system for reforestation with native species designed for timber production or carbon sequestration because this system is more economically viable and productive than pure plantations.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Both local- and landscape-scale processes drive succession of secondary forests in human-modified tropical landscapes. Nonetheless, until recently successional changes in composition and diversity have been predominantly studied at the patch level. Here, we used a unique dataset with 45 randomly selected sites across a mixed-use tropical landscape in central Panama to study forest succession simultaneously on local and landscape scales and across both life stages (seedling, sapling, juvenile and adult trees) and life forms (shrubs, trees, lianas, and palms). To understand the potential of these secondary forests to conserve tree species diversity, we also evaluated the diversity of species that can persist as viable metapopulations in a dynamic patchwork of short-lived successional forests, using different assumptions about the average relative size at reproductive maturity. We found a deterministic shift in the diversity and composition of the local plant communities as well as the metacommunity, driven by variation in the rate at which species recruited into and disappeared from the secondary forests across the landscape. Our results indicate that dispersal limitation and the successional niche operate simultaneously and shape successional dynamics of the metacommunity of these early secondary forests. A high diversity of plant species across the metacommunity of early secondary forests shows a potential for restoration of diverse forests through natural succession, when trees and fragments of older forests are maintained in the agricultural matrix and land is abandoned or set aside for a long period of time. On the other hand, during the first 32 years the number of species with mature-sized individuals was a relatively small and strongly biased sub-sample of the total species pool. This implies that ephemeral secondary forests have a limited role in the long-term conservation of tree species diversity in human-modified tropical landscapes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Regrowth of tropical secondary forests following complete or nearly complete removal of forest vegetation actively stores carbon in aboveground biomass, partially counterbalancing carbon emissions from deforestation, forest degradation, burning of fossil fuels, and other anthropogenic sources. We estimate the age and spatial extent of lowland second-growth forests in the Latin American tropics and model their potential aboveground carbon accumulation over four decades. Our model shows that, in 2008, second-growth forests (1 to 60 years old) covered 2.4 million km2 of land (28.1\% of the total study area). Over 40 years, these lands can potentially accumulate a total aboveground carbon stock of 8.48 Pg C (petagrams of carbon) in aboveground biomass via low-cost natural regeneration or assisted regeneration, corresponding to a total {CO}2 sequestration of 31.09 Pg {CO}2. This total is equivalent to carbon emissions from fossil fuel use and industrial processes in all of Latin America and the Caribbean from 1993 to 2014. Ten countries account for 95\% of this carbon storage potential, led by Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. We model future land-use scenarios to guide national carbon mitigation policies. Permitting natural regeneration on 40\% of lowland pastures potentially stores an additional 2.0 Pg C over 40 years. Our study provides information and maps to guide national-level forest-based carbon mitigation plans on the basis of estimated rates of natural regeneration and pasture abandonment. Coupled with avoided deforestation and sustainable forest management, natural regeneration of second-growth forests provides a low-cost mechanism that yields a high carbon sequestration potential with multiple benefits for biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Adaptations to resource availability strongly shape patterns of community composition along successional gradients in environmental conditions. In the present study, we examined the extent to which variation in functional composition explains shifts in trait-based functional strategies in young tropical secondary forests during the most dynamic stage of succession (0–20 years). Functional composition of two size classes in 51 secondary forest plots was determined using community-weighted means of seven functional traits, which were intensively measured on 55 woody plant species (n = 875–1,761 individuals). Along the successional gradient in forest structure, there was a significant and consistent shift in functional strategies from resource acquisition to resource conservation. Leaf toughness and adult plant size increased significantly, while net photosynthetic capacity (A                        mass) decreased significantly during succession. Shifts in functional strategies within size classes for A                        mass and wood density also support the hypothesis that changes in functional composition are shaped by environmental conditions along successional gradients. In general, ‘hard’ functional traits, e.g., A                        mass and leaf toughness, linked to different facets of plant performance exhibited greater sensitivity to successional changes in forest structure than ‘soft’ traits, such as leaf mass area and leaf dry matter content. Our results also suggested that stochastic processes related to previous land-use history, dispersal limitation, and abiotic factors explained variation in functional composition beyond that attributed to deterministic shifts in functional strategies. Further data on seed dispersal vectors and distance and landscape configuration are needed to improve current mechanistic models of succession in tropical secondary forests.},

	abstract = {Abstract Earthworms drive important ecosystem functions like decomposition and nutrient mineralization in many terrestrial ecosystems, which is why factors controlling their mass gain are of great scientific interest. We conducted a microcosm experiment using two common endogeic earthworm species (Aporrectodea caliginosa and Octolasion tyrtaeum) and two different soils (one from a beech-dominated forest and one from a mixed tree species forest in Germany) to test litter quality (different nutrient concentrations) and soil quality effects (low and high) on relative mass gain of earthworms. We hypothesized that mass gain of endogeic earthworms is driven by both soil and litter quality. Soil {pH}, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations were used to characterize soil quality, while leaf litter N, phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) concentrations were used as proxies for leaf litter quality. Forest soils were incubated with leaf litter of six common tree species in Central Europe (Fagus sylvatica, Acer platanoides, Acer pseudoplatanus, Carpinus betulus, Tilia spp., and Fraxinus excelsior) that span a gradient in leaf litter quality. In addition, we determined soil microbial biomass C as a potential food source of endogeic earthworms. After three months, relative earthworm mass gain of A. caliginosa and O. tyrtaeum was significantly higher in soil from the mixed tree species forest (high quality soil: +218\% and +240\%, respectively) compared to soil from the beech-dominated forest (low quality soil: +160\% and +162\%, respectively). Relative mass gain of A. caliginosa increased significantly with all leaf litter nutrients in low quality soil, whereas in high quality soil only leaf litter Ca positively affected relative mass gain. Similarly, relative mass gain of O. tyrtaeum increased significantly with increasing concentrations of leaf litter N, Mg, and Ca in the low quality soil. In the high quality soil, only leaf litter Mg significantly increased relative mass gain. Overall, our results indicate that leaf litter quality effects on endogeic earthworm mass gain were more important in low quality soil for both earthworm species. Notably, microbial biomass was significantly higher in high quality soil (506 ± 135 μg C g−1 soil dw) compared to low quality soil (217 ± 64 μg C g−1 soil dw), but microbial biomass was not significantly affected by leaf litter type and was a poor predictor of relative earthworm mass gain. This finding indicates that endogeic earthworms did not significantly depend on soil microbial biomass, but rather on the quality of dead organic material in the soil and surface leaf litter. As earthworms may prefer feeding on certain microbial taxa, and we only measured total soil microbial biomass, future studies could investigate if leaf litter quality effects on earthworms are mediated by changes in soil microbial community structure, micronutrients, and organic compounds.},

While less conspicuous than introduced aboveground organisms, introduced belowground organisms may have similarly strong effects. Here, we synthesize for the first time the impacts of introduced earthworms on plant diversity and community composition in North American forests. We conducted a meta-analysis using a total of 645 observations to quantify mean effect sizes of associations between introduced earthworm communities and plant diversity, cover of plant functional groups, and cover of native and non-native plants. We found that plant diversity significantly declined with increasing richness of introduced earthworm ecological groups. While plant species richness or evenness did not change with earthworm invasion, our results indicate clear changes in plant community composition: cover of graminoids and non-native plant species significantly increased, and cover of native plant species (of all functional groups) tended to decrease, with increasing earthworm biomass. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that introduced earthworms facilitate particular plant species adapted to the abiotic conditions of earthworm-invaded forests. Further, our study provides evidence that introduced earthworms are associated with declines in plant diversity in North American forests. Changing plant functional composition in these forests may have long-lasting effects on ecosystem functioning.},

Using the largest global plant trait database and state of the art Bayesian modeling, we created fine-grained global maps of plant trait distributions that can be applied to Earth system models. Focusing on a set of plant traits closely coupled to photosynthesis and foliar respiration—specific leaf area ({SLA}) and dry mass-based concentrations of leaf nitrogen ({NmNm}{\textless}mml:math{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}N{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi{\textgreater}m{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:math{\textgreater}) and phosphorus ({PmPm}{\textless}mml:math{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}P{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi{\textgreater}m{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:math{\textgreater}), we characterize how traits vary within and among over 50,000 ∼50×50∼50×50{\textless}mml:math{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mo{\textgreater}∼{\textless}/mml:mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mn{\textgreater}50{\textless}/mml:mn{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mo{\textgreater}×{\textless}/mml:mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mn{\textgreater}50{\textless}/mml:mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:math{\textgreater}-km cells across the entire vegetated land surface.

This endeavor advances prior trait mapping by generating global maps that preserve variability across scales by using modern Bayesian spatial statistical modeling in combination with a database over three times larger than that in previous analyses.

	abstract = {Abstract In a recent Forum paper, Wardle (Journal of Vegetation Science, 2016) questions the value of biodiversity?ecosystem function ({BEF}) experiments with respect to their implications for biodiversity changes in real world communities. The main criticism is that the previous focus of {BEF} experiments on random species assemblages within each level of diversity has ?limited the understanding of how natural communities respond to biodiversity loss.? He concludes that a broader spectrum of approaches considering both non?random gains and losses of diversity is essential to advance this field of research. Wardle's paper is timely because of recent observations of frequent local and regional biodiversity changes across ecosystems. While we appreciate that new and complementary experimental approaches are required for advancing the field, we question criticisms regarding the validity of {BEF} experiments. Therefore, we respond by briefly reiterating previous arguments emphasizing the reasoning behind random species composition in {BEF} experiments. We describe how {BEF} experiments have identified important mechanisms that play a role in real world ecosystems, advancing our understanding of ecosystem responses to species gains and losses. We discuss recent examples where theory derived from {BEF} experiments enriched our understanding of the consequences of biodiversity changes in real world ecosystems and where comprehensive analyses and integrative modelling approaches confirmed patterns found in {BEF} experiments. Finally, we provide some promising directions in {BEF} research.},

	abstract = {The widely observed positive relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem functioning is thought to be substantially driven by complementary resource use of plant species. Recent work suggests that biotic interactions among plants and between plants and soil organisms drive key aspects of resource use complementarity. Here, we provide a conceptual framework for integrating positive biotic interactions across guilds of organisms, more specifically between plants and mycorrhizal types, to explain resource use complementarity in plants and its consequences for plant competition. Our overarching hypothesis is that ecosystem functioning increases when more plant species associate with functionally dissimilar mycorrhizal fungi because differing mycorrhizal types will increase coverage of habitat space for and reduce competition among plants. We introduce a recently established field experiment ({MyDiv}) that uses different pools of tree species that associate with either arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal fungi to create orthogonal experimental gradients in tree species richness and mycorrhizal associations and present initial results. Finally, we discuss options for future mechanistic studies on resource use complementarity within {MyDiv}. We show how mycorrhizal types and biotic interactions in {MyDiv} can be used in the future to test novel questions regarding the mechanisms underlying biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships.},

	abstract = {Aims Successional shifts in biodiversity are key drivers of the recovery of ecosystem functioning following disturbances. Identifying mechanisms that enhance or limit the ecological processes that drive these successional patterns can strengthen efforts to manage biodiversity-dependent ecosystem functions across human-dominated landscapes. Here, we examine successional patterns of multiple aspects of functional diversity in a seasonally wet tropical secondary forest and changes in the strength of environmental filtering during secondary succession. Location Central Panama. Methods We calculate functional richness ({FRic}) and dispersion ({FDis}) across a secondary forest chronosequence (n = 51 0.1-ha plots) using nine functional traits related to resource acquisition and conservation. Functional diversity indices are calculated using all traits and each trait individually. Using a null model approach, we test the effects of environmental filtering during secondary succession. Results {FRic} and {FDis} exhibit saturating relationships with time since abandonment, reaching their maxima after 7 and 10 years, respectively. Overall, we find evidence that environmental filtering reduces {FDis} to a greater extent than {FRic} and that the strength of environmental filtering on both {FDis} and {FRic} increases during succession. The impacts of environmental filtering on functional diversity of individual traits are consistent; the mean standardized effect sizes ({SES}) of {FRic} and {FDis} of at least six of the nine studied traits are lower than expected. Notably, environmental filtering on {FRic} and {FDis} of particular traits associated with light and nutrient acquisition increases significantly along the secondary forest chronosequence, suggesting that functional convergence of multiple resource acquisition strategies strengthens in parallel. Conclusions We find that successional shifts in environmental conditions limit trait variation in seasonally wet tropical secondary forests. Our results suggest that the increasing strength of environmental filtering shifts abundance of trait combinations towards a subset of functionally convergent species that compete for light and nutrients in similar ways.},

	abstract = {A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that biodiversity stabilizes ecosystem functioning over time in grassland ecosystems. However, the relative importance of different facets of biodiversity underlying the diversity–stability relationship remains unclear. Here we use data from 39 grassland biodiversity experiments and structural equation modelling to investigate the roles of species richness, phylogenetic diversity and both the diversity and community-weighted mean of functional traits representing the ‘fast–slow’ leaf economics spectrum in driving the diversity–stability relationship. We found that high species richness and phylogenetic diversity stabilize biomass production via enhanced asynchrony in the performance of co-occurring species. Contrary to expectations, low phylogenetic diversity enhances ecosystem stability directly, albeit weakly. While the diversity of fast–slow functional traits has a weak effect on ecosystem stability, communities dominated by slow species enhance ecosystem stability by increasing mean biomass production relative to the standard deviation of biomass over time. Our in-depth, integrative assessment of factors influencing the diversity–stability relationship demonstrates a more multicausal relationship than has been previously acknowledged.},

	abstract = {Abstract Soil resource partitioning and dispersal limitation have been shown to shape the tree community structure of mature tropical forests, but are poorly studied in the context of forest succession. We examined the relative contributions of both ecological processes to the variation in the species composition of young tropical secondary forests at different spatial scales, and if the relative importance of these two ecological processes changed during succession. At the species level, we examined if the association between species abundances and soil fertility differed between early and late successional species and/or changed over the course of succession. We used vegetation and soil data from 47 secondary forest sites with two plots each in a tropical agricultural landscape. A distance-based redundancy analysis and variation partitioning were employed to examine the relative importance of spatial distance (proxy for dispersal limitation) and heterogeneity in soil nutrients (proxy for soil nutrient partitioning) at the landscape scale, and a linear regression to test their effects at the local scale. We examined interspecific variation in species’ responses to successional age and soil nutrients with a joint species distribution model. Dispersal limitation and soil niche partitioning drove considerable variation in the composition of plant communities at local and landscape scales. The relative contribution of these two ecological processes changed with scale (local vs. landscape) and topography (lower slope vs. upper slope plots). At the species level, significant abundance–soil fertility associations were mostly positive. Most species became less responsive to soil nutrients over the first few decades of tropical forest succession, probably because light became the main limiting resource in older forests. Synthesis. Our key finding is that spatial heterogeneity in soil resources and spatial distance jointly drive compositional variation within and across early successional forests. Our results highlight that a network of forest fragments enhances the resilience of ecological processes and the potential of secondary forests to restore and preserve biodiversity in human-modified landscapes. To advance our understanding of ecological succession, we need to move beyond single-factor and local-scale studies and examine the effects of multiple variables on succession at different spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Earth is experiencing a substantial loss of biodiversity at the global scale, while both species gains and losses are occurring at local and regional scales. The influence of these nonrandom changes in species distributions could profoundly affect the functioning of ecosystems and the essential services that they provide. However, few experimental tests have been conducted examining the influence of species invasions on ecosystem functioning. Even fewer have been conducted using invasive ecosystem engineers, which can have disproportionately strong influence on native ecosystems relative to their own biomass. The invasion of exotic earthworms is a prime example of an ecosystem engineer that is influencing many ecosystems around the world. In particular, European earthworm invasions of northern North American forests cause simultaneous species gains and losses with significant consequences for essential ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling and crucial services to humanity like soil erosion control and carbon sequestration. Exotic earthworms are expected to select for specific traits in communities of soil microorganisms (fast-growing bacteria species), soil fauna (promoting the bacterial energy channel), and plants (graminoids) through direct and indirect effects. This will accelerate some ecosystem processes and decelerate others, fundamentally altering how invaded forests function. This project aims to investigate ecosystem responses of northern North American forests to earthworm invasion. Using a novel, synthetic combination of field observations, field experiments, lab experiments, and meta-analyses, the proposed work will be the first systematic examination of earthworm effects on (1) plant communities and (2) soil food webs and processes. Further, (3) effects of a changing climate (warming and reduced summer precipitation) on earthworm performance will be investigated in a unique field experiment designed to predict the future spread and consequences of earthworm invasion in North America. By assessing the soil chemical and physical properties as well as the taxonomic (e.g., by the latest next-generation sequencing techniques) and functional composition of plant, soil microbial and animal communities and the processes they drive in four forests, work packages I-{III} take complementary approaches to derive a comprehensive and generalizable picture of how ecosystems change in response to earthworm invasion. Finally, in work package {IV}, meta-analyses will be used to integrate the information from work packages I-{III} and existing literature to investigate if earthworms cause invasion waves, invasion meltdowns, habitat homogenization, and ecosystem state shifts. Global data will be synthesized to test if the relative magnitude of effects differs from place to place depending on the functional dissimilarity between native soil fauna and exotic earthworms. Moving from local to global scale, the present proposal examines the influence of earthworm invasions on biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships from an aboveground–belowground perspective in natural settings. This approach is highly innovative as it utilizes the invasion by exotic earthworms as an exciting model system that links invasion biology with trait-based community ecology, global change research, and ecosystem ecology, pioneering a new generation of biodiversity–ecosystem functioning research.},

	abstract = {The relationship between an island’s size and the number of species on that island—the island species-area relationship ({ISAR})—is one of the most well-known patterns in biogeography, and forms the basis for understanding biodiversity loss in response to habitat loss and fragmentation. Nevertheless, there is contention about exactly how to estimate the {ISAR}, and the influence of the three primary ecological mechanisms—sampling, area per se, and heterogeneity— that drive it. Key to this contention is that estimates of the {ISAR} are often confounded by sampling and estimates of measures (i.e., island-level species richness) that are not diagnostic of potential mechanisms. Here, we advocate a sampling-explicit approach for dissecting the possible ecological mechanisms underlying the {ISAR} using individual-based rarefaction curves estimated across spatial scales. Specifically, we show how {ISAR} mechanisms can be inferred by comparing the relationship between island area and diversity indices derived from regional (γ-) and local (α-) individual-based rarefaction curves. If the parameters derived from rarefaction curves at each spatial scale show no relationship with island area, we cannot reject the hypothesis that {ISARs} result only from sampling effects. However, if the parameters derived from the rarefactions change with island area, effects beyond sampling (i.e., area per se or heterogeneity) are operating. Additionally, if parameters indicative of within-island spatial variation in species composition (i.e., β-diversity) increase with island area, intra-island compositional heterogeneity plays a role in driving the {ISAR}. We illustrate this approach using representative case studies, including oceanic islands, natural island-like patches, and habitat fragments from formerly continuous habitat, illustrating several combinations of underlying mechanisms. This approach will offer insight into the role of sampling and other processes that underpin the {ISAR}, providing a more complete understanding of how, and some indication of why, patterns of biodiversity respond to gradients in island area.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests are converted at an alarming rate for agricultural use and pastureland, but also regrow naturally through secondary succession. For successful forest restoration, it is essential to understand the mechanisms of secondary succession. These mechanisms may vary across forest types, but analyses across broad spatial scales are lacking. Here, we analyse forest recovery using 1,403 plots that differ in age since agricultural abandonment from 50 sites across the Neotropics. We analyse changes in community composition using species-specific stem wood density ({WD}), which is a key trait for plant growth, survival and forest carbon storage. In wet forest, succession proceeds from low towards high community {WD} (acquisitive towards conservative trait values), in line with standard successional theory. However, in dry forest, succession proceeds from high towards low community {WD} (conservative towards acquisitive trait values), probably because high {WD} reflects drought tolerance in harsh early successional environments. Dry season intensity drives {WD} recovery by influencing the start and trajectory of succession, resulting in convergence of the community {WD} over time as vegetation cover builds up. These ecological insights can be used to improve species selection for reforestation. Reforestation species selected to establish a first protective canopy layer should, among other criteria, ideally have a similar {WD} to the early successional communities that dominate under the prevailing macroclimatic conditions.},

	abstract = {Conversion of structurally complex rainforests into simplified oil palm monocultures leads to dramatic losses of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. To alleviate negative ecological impacts, enrichment with native tree species may rapidly restore structural complexity in existing oil palm plantations. However, the mechanisms underlying the recovery of structural complexity in mixed-species tree plantings remain poorly understood. We measured structural complexity from terrestrial laser scanning in a biodiversity enrichment experiment with multiple tree species planted in an oil palm monoculture, forming agroforestry plots of varying tree species diversity and plot size. We find that three years after tree planting, structural complexity in oil palm increased by one third, representing 25\% of the increase needed to restore the structural complexity of tropical forests. Changes in structural complexity were associated with denser and more complex filling of three-dimensional space, whereas vertical stratification was mainly influenced by oil palm. Furthermore, structural complexity increased with tree species diversity in the agroforestry plots. This relationship was mainly due the presence of well-performing species that contributed to higher levels of structural complexity. However, interactions among multiple species independently from the species identity were also detected. Finally, increasing plot size had a positive effect on a scale-independent measure of structural complexity. Our results provide evidence that planting multiple tree species in large agroforestry plots is a suitable strategy to rapidly enhance structural complexity in oil palm plantations.},

	abstract = {The study of biodiversity has grown exponentially in the last thirty years in response to demands for greater understanding of the function and importance of Earth's biodiversity and finding solutions to conserve it. Here, we test the hypothesis that biodiversity science has become more interdisciplinary over time. To do so, we analyze 97,945 peer-reviewed articles over a twenty-two-year time period (1990–2012) with a continuous time dynamic model, which classifies articles into concepts (i.e., topics and ideas) based on word co-occurrences. Using the model output, we then quantify different aspects of interdisciplinarity: concept diversity, that is, the diversity of topics and ideas across subdisciplines in biodiversity science, subdiscipline diversity, that is, the diversity of subdisciplines across concepts, and network structure, which captures interactions between concepts and subdisciplines. We found that, on average, concept and subdiscipline diversity in biodiversity science were either stable or declining, patterns which were driven by the persistence of rare concepts and subdisciplines and a decline in the diversity of common concepts and subdisciplines, respectively. Moreover, our results provide evidence that conceptual homogenization, that is, decreases in temporal β concept diversity, underlies the observed trends in interdisciplinarity. Together, our results reveal that biodiversity science is undergoing a dynamic phase as a scientific discipline that is consolidating around a core set of concepts. Our results suggest that progress toward addressing the biodiversity crisis via greater interdisciplinarity during the study period may have been slowed by extrinsic factors, such as the failure to invest in research spanning across concepts and disciplines. However, recent initiatives such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services ({IPBES}) may attract broader support for biodiversity-related issues and hence interdisciplinary approaches to address scientific, political, and societal challenges in the coming years.},

Using 26 long-term grassland and forest experimental ecosystems, we demonstrate that biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships strengthen mainly by greater increases in functioning in high-diversity communities in grasslands and forests. In grasslands, biodiversity effects also strengthen due to decreases in functioning in low-diversity communities. Contrasting trends across grasslands are associated with differences in soil characteristics.},

	abstract = {Integrating evolutionary and ecological factors is an essential step toward reaching a more complete understanding of the mechanisms underlying biodiversity patterns. While oceanic islands are often used as natural laboratories, typical analyses lack information about species abundances and distributions within islands that is necessary to disentangle the effects of biogeographical and ecological factors on biodiversity. We analyze forests across the Hawaiian archipelago and show that the effects of island age on diversity patterns of native species percolate across spatial scales via the distribution of rare species. However, we found that biological invasions are eroding the signal of island age on biodiversity. Overall, we show that diversity patterns across a biodiversity hotspot reflect the joint influence of contemporary and historical drivers.Biodiversity patterns emerge as a consequence of evolutionary and ecological processes. Their relative importance is frequently tested on model ecosystems such as oceanic islands that vary in both. However, the coarse-scale data typically used in biogeographic studies have limited inferential power to separate the effects of historical biogeographic factors (e.g., island age) from the effects of ecological ones (e.g., island area and habitat heterogeneity). Here, we describe local-scale biodiversity patterns of woody plants using a database of more than 500 forest plots from across the Hawaiian archipelago, where these volcanic islands differ in age by several million years. We show that, after controlling for factors such as island area and heterogeneity, the oldest islands (Kauai and Oahu) have greater native species diversity per unit area than younger islands (Maui and Hawaii), indicating an important role for macroevolutionary processes in driving not just whole-island differences in species diversity, but also local community assembly. Further, we find that older islands have a greater number of rare species that are more spatially clumped (i.e., higher within-island β-diversity) than younger islands. When we included alien species in our analyses, we found that the signal of macroevolutionary processes via island age was diluted. Our approach allows a more explicit test of the question of how macroevolutionary factors shape not just regional-scale biodiversity, but also local-scale community assembly patterns and processes in a model archipelago ecosystem, and it can be applied to disentangle biodiversity drivers in other systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim We mapped global patterns of tree phylogenetic endemism ({PE}) to identify hotspots and test hypotheses about possible drivers. Specifically, we tested hypotheses related to current climate, geographical characteristics and historical conditions and assessed their relative importance in shaping {PE} patterns. Location Global. Time period We used the present distribution of trees, and predictors covering conditions from the mid-Miocene to present. Major taxa studied All seed-bearing trees. Methods We compiled distributions for 58,542 tree species across 463 regions worldwide, matched these to a recent phylogeny of seed plants and calculated {PE} for each region. We used a suite of predictor variables describing current climate (e.g., mean annual temperature), geographical characteristics (e.g., isolation) and historical conditions (e.g., tree cover at the Last Glacial Maximum) in a spatial regression model to explain variation in {PE}. Results Tree {PE} was highest on islands, and was higher closer to the equator. All three groups of predictor variables contributed substantially to the {PE} pattern. Isolation and topographic heterogeneity promoted high {PE}, as did high current tree cover. Among mainland regions, temperature seasonality was strongly negatively related to {PE}, while mean annual temperature was positively related to {PE} on islands. Some relationships differed among the major floristic regions. For example, tree cover at the Last Glacial Maximum was a positive predictor of {PE} in the Palaeotropics, while tree cover at the Miocene was a negative predictor of {PE} in the Neotropics. Main conclusions Globally, {PE} can be explained by a combination of geographical, historical and current factors. Some geographical variables appear to be key predictors of {PE}. However, the impact of historic and current climate variables differs considerably among the major floristic regions, reflecting their unique histories. Hence, the current distribution of trees is the result of globally relevant geographical drivers and regional climatic histories.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Understanding patterns of tropical plant diversity and their vulnerability to anthropogenic disturbance at different spatial scales remains a great challenge in ecology and conservation. Here, we study how the effects of forest-use intensity on vascular epiphyte diversity vary along a tropical elevational gradient. Location 3,500-m elevational gradient along the eastern slopes of Cofre de Perote, Mexico. Methods We studied the effects of forest-use intensity on alpha, beta and gamma diversity of vascular epiphyte assemblages in old-growth, degraded and secondary forests at eight study sites at 500-m intervals along the elevational gradient. At each elevation and in each of the three forest-use intensity levels, we established five 400-m2 plots yielding a total of 120 plots. Results Interactive effects of elevation and forest-use intensity strongly impacted local-scale patterns of vascular epiphyte diversity. Species diversity peaked at 500 as well as 1,500 m above sea level, which deviates from the previously reported hump-shaped pattern. In most cases, alpha diversity did not differ significantly among forest-use intensity levels. However, gamma diversity was always lower in secondary forests compared to old-growth forests across the entire elevational gradient. Within each elevational belt, beta diversity was dominated by species turnover along the forest-use intensity gradient in the lowlands and declined with increasing elevation, where community composition became increasingly nested. Along the elevational gradient, the spatial turnover of vascular epiphyte community composition was similar among forest-use intensity levels. Main conclusions Our results reveal a strong interaction between forest-use intensity and elevation, making it difficult to extrapolate findings from one elevational belt to another. Our findings highlight the value of old-growth forest for epiphyte diversity, but also show that degraded and secondary forests?depending on the elevational belt?may maintain a high species diversity and thus play an important role in conservation planning.},

	abstract = {Seed arrival is a limiting factor for the regeneration of diverse tropical forests and may be an important mechanism that drives patterns of tree species’ distribution. Here we quantify spatial and seasonal variation in seed rain of secondary forests in southern Bahia, Brazil. We also examine whether secondary forest age enhances seed dispersal and whether seed rain density and diversity in secondary forests decay with distance from mature forest. Across a chronosequence of 15 pairs of mature and secondary forests, 105 seed traps were installed and monitored for one year. We tested the effects of secondary forest age, distance from mature forest, and seasonality on monthly seed rain density, diversity, seed dispersal mode, and diaspore size. We found that secondary forest age had strong, positive effects on the diversity of seed rain, which was generally higher during the wet season. Moreover, contrasting patterns among diversity indices revealed that seeds of rare species occurred more often in 40 yr old secondary forests and mature forests. While the proportion of biotically and abiotically dispersed seeds did not change significantly with distance from mature forest across all forest age classes, we found that biotically dispersed seeds contributed disproportionately more to seed rain diversity. Our results emphasize the importance of biotic dispersal to enhance diversity during secondary succession and suggest that changes in secondary forest structure have the potential to enhance the diversity of tropical secondary forests, principally by increasing dispersal of rare species.},

	abstract = {Plant traits—the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants—determine how plants respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, and influence ecosystem properties and their benefits and detriments to people. Plant trait data thus represent the basis for a vast area of research spanning from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology, to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem and landscape management, restoration, biogeography and earth system modelling. Since its foundation in 2007, the {TRY} database of plant traits has grown continuously. It now provides unprecedented data coverage under an open access data policy and is the main plant trait database used by the research community worldwide. Increasingly, the {TRY} database also supports new frontiers of trait-based plant research, including the identification of data gaps and the subsequent mobilization or measurement of new data. To support this development, in this article we evaluate the extent of the trait data compiled in {TRY} and analyse emerging patterns of data coverage and representativeness. Best species coverage is achieved for categorical traits—almost complete coverage for ‘plant growth form’. However, most traits relevant for ecology and vegetation modelling are characterized by continuous intraspecific variation and trait–environmental relationships. These traits have to be measured on individual plants in their respective environment. Despite unprecedented data coverage, we observe a humbling lack of completeness and representativeness of these continuous traits in many aspects. We, therefore, conclude that reducing data gaps and biases in the {TRY} database remains a key challenge and requires a coordinated approach to data mobilization and trait measurements. This can only be achieved in collaboration with other initiatives.},

	abstract = {Abstract Question Land-use change and intensification are currently the most pervasive threats to tropical biodiversity. Yet, their effects on biodiversity change with elevation are unknown. Here, we examine how tree diversity and community composition vary with elevation and how the effects of forest use intensity on tree diversity and community composition change within elevations. Location Eastern slopes of the Cofre de Perote mountain, state of Veracruz, Mexico. Methods We assessed tree diversity and composition using a sampling design in which elevation was crossed with three levels of forest use intensity: old-growth, degraded, and secondary forests. We established 120 20 m × 20 m forest plots, located at eight sites between 0 m and 3,545 m. At each site, five replicate plots were inventoried for each level of forest use intensity. Results Our analyses revealed an interactive effect between elevation and forest use intensity affecting tree diversity and community composition along the elevational gradient. Contrasting effects of forest use intensity within elevation resulted in tree diversity following a low-plateau pattern for old-growth and a bimodal pattern for degraded and secondary forests. Along the entire elevational gradient, there were 217 tree species distributed within 154 genera and 80 families. Species accumulation curves revealed that forests at 0 m and 1,500 m elevation showed differences in species richness among forest use intensities. In contrast, species richness did not differ between old-growth forest and the other forest use intensities in five of the eight studied elevations. In terms of community composition, secondary forests differed from old-growth and degraded forests. Conclusion Our results suggest that the interactive effects of elevation and forest use intensity change tree diversity patterns and community composition along a tropical elevational gradient. Degraded forests were similar to old-growth forests in terms of species diversity and composition, suggesting that they may act as a safeguard of tree diversity in human-dominated tropical landscapes.},
