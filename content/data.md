## Data  
![Islands](/images/ElJiral_paisaje_b_w3.png)  

I collected a moderate amount of new data as part of my graduate research in Panama, but more recently 
have benefitted enormously from the generous of others that share their data with me. Inspired by 
[Open Traits](https://opentraits.org)/) and [Will Pearse](http://pearselab.com/), I have started to slowly clean and standardize my data
 and to make them open (via Figshare). 

1. __Panama Secondary Forest Traits__: 17 traits measured on 55 woody species and up to 1700 individuals per species

2. __Centre-du-Quebec Forest Plots__: This is a dataset of 395 plots (100 m2) distributed within and across 42 forest fragments in central Quebec, Canada.
