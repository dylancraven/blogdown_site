## Data  
![Islands](/images/ElJiral_paisaje_b_w3.png)  

I collected a moderate amount of new data as part of my graduate research in Panama, but more recently 
have benefitted enormously from the generosity of others that share their data with me. Inspired by 
[Open Traits](https://opentraits.org)/) and [Will Pearse](http://pearselab.com/), I have started to 
standardize my data and to make them open (via Figshare).   

1. __Panama Secondary Forest Traits__: 17 traits measured on 55 woody species and up to 1700 individuals per species
