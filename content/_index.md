## Biodiversity | Functional Ecology & Biogeography

### Dylan Craven

I am an associate professor at the [Centre for Ecosystem Modeling and Monitoring](https://www.umayor.cl/um/vicerrectoria-investigacion/centros-de-investigacion) within Universidad Mayor, in Santiago, Chile.

In my research, I explore drivers of temporal and spatial patterns of biodiversity and biodiversity change and their consequences, mostly in grassland and forest ecosystems. I am fortunate enough to work in a country - Chile - whose unique geography and climate provide a compelling template to address the following questions:

 __i) How do biodiversity and biodiversity-dependent ecosystem functions vary across temporal and spatial scales?__

__ii) How does biodiversity mediate ecosystem responses to global change drivers?__

__iii) How do global change drivers alter biodiversity patterns and its underlying mechanisms?__
