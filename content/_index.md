## Biodiversity | Functional Ecology & Biogeography

### Dylan Craven

I am an associate professor at Universidad Mayor in the [Centre for Ecosystem Modeling and Monitoring](https://cem.umayor.cl/) in Santiago, Chile.

In my research, I explore drivers of temporal and spatial patterns of biodiversity and biodiversity change and their consequences, mostly in grassland and forest ecosystems. I am fortunate to work in a country - Chile - whose unique geography and climate provide a compelling template to address the following questions:

 __i) How do ecological and historical drivers jointly shape biodiversity patterns?__  
 
__ii)  How do biodiversity and biodiversity-dependent ecosystem functions vary across temporal and spatial scales?__

__iii) How does biodiversity mediate ecosystem responses to global change drivers?__
