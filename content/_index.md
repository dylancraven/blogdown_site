We explore drivers of temporal and spatial patterns of biodiversity and biodiversity change and their consequences, mostly in grassland and forest ecosystems. We are based in Chile, whose unique geography and climate provide a compelling template to address the following [questions](/research):

 __i) How do ecological and historical drivers jointly shape biodiversity patterns?__  
 
__ii)  How do biodiversity and biodiversity-dependent ecosystem functions vary across temporal and spatial scales?__

__iii) How does biodiversity mediate ecosystem responses to global change drivers?__
