We explore drivers of temporal and spatial patterns of biodiversity and biodiversity change and their consequences, mostly in grassland and forest ecosystems. We are based in Chile, whose unique geography and climate provide a compelling template to address the following [questions](/research):

**i) How do ecological and historical drivers jointly shape biodiversity patterns?**

**ii) How does biodiversity mediate ecosystem processes to global change drivers across temporal and spatial scales?**

If interested in joining our research team or collaborating with us, please check out [opportunities](/join) or contact Dr. Craven via e-mail: dylan.craven[at]umayor.cl (English/Espa√±ol).
