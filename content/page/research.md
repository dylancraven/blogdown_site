## Drivers of functional diversity of woody plants and consequences for carbon storage

Identifying the drivers of biodiversity and their relationships with ecosystem functioning across large spatial scales is essential for strengthening the conservation  
and management of natural ecosystems. Chile is an excellent natural laboratory for studying spatial patterns of biodiversity’s multiple facets, given its diversity  
in environmental conditions and topography and unique biogeographic history. However, there are persistent shortfalls in [biodiversity data in Chile](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.13755)  
that have prevented addressing such issues. Bridging extant gaps in biodiversity data and knowledge of ecosystems in biodiversity hotspots such as Chile remains a major scientific challenge.    

In this project, we aim to identify the environmental, geographical, and anthropogenic factors that shape spatial patterns of woody plant diversity  
across Chile and to quantify the extent to which carbon storage is affected by biodiversity.

## Impacts of extreme droughts     

With a multi-disciplinary group of colleagues, we are developing a multi-scale platform to 
monitor drought and its multi-faceted impacts in Chile (see [**Observatorio de sequía para la agricultura y biodiversidad de Chile**](https://odes-chile.org/)),  
at national and regional scales. My team is focused on examining where and how biodiversity may buffer the impacts of the extreme drought in Chile (2010-present).

## Mechanisms underlying ecosystem stability and community responses to global change   

Biodiversity experiments in grassland & forest ecosystems provide a powerful platform to identify mechanisms underlying biodiversity-ecosystem function  
and biodiversity-ecosystem stability relationships. Furthermore, the relative importance of biodiversity and its mechanisms, such as complementarity,  
may be altered by global change drivers. We primarily use [synthesis](https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/users/173594-dylan-craven/posts/37387-synthesizing-people-and-data-to-understand-the-multiple-drivers-of-ecosystem-stability)  
to understand how generalisable these mechanisms are. Based on insights gained from these synthesis projects, we develop greenhouse & field studies to  
test 'next-generation' questions.

## Resilience of tropical and temperate secondary forests    

Secondary forests dominate large areas of tropical and temperate regions and have considerable potential to mitigate climate change via carbon sequestration 
and to act as a source of biodiversity. Therefore, it is critical to understand how biodiversity and biodiversity-dependent ecosystem functions recover in secondary 
forests following land abandonment. Within the Agua Salud Project in **Panama**, we leverage time series data across an extensive network of forest plots to explore 
the consequences of biodiversity change on ecosystem functioning. We also collaborate with the [2NDFOR network](https://sites.google.com/view/2ndfor/home), in which we 
examine patterns and drivers of forest recovery across the tropics.

In **Chile**, we collaborate with [Pablo Donoso](https://www.forestal.uach.cl/instituto/bosques-sociedad/academicos/academico.php?s=pablo-donoso) (Universidad Austral)  
and [Daniel Soto](https://sites.google.com/view/silviculture/danielsotowebpage?authuser=0) (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile) to examine the impacts of forest  
management on ecological resilience in temperate rainforests.

## Biodiversity patterns across islands at local and biogeographical scales  

Island ecosystems sustain a large proportion of global plant diversity, yet are critically imperiled due to global change. They are also a natural  
laboratory that can be used to examine how biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and biological invasions change from local to biogeographical scales.  
We use an database of forest plots on islands across the Pacific Ocean to address these questions, in collaboration with [Holger Kreft (U. of Gottingen)](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/218853.html),    
[Patrick Weigelt (Radboud University)](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/weigelt-p), and [Tiffany Knight (NTBG)](https://ntbg.org/science/staff/).  
Our initial work has focused on the Hawaiian Islands and now are expanding our focus to the entire Pacific Ocean (see [publications]({{< ref "/page/publications" >}})).
