      <description>Biodiversity patterns across islands at local and biogeographical scales Island ecosystems sustain a large proportion of global plant diversity, yet are critically imperiled due to global change. They are also a natural laboratory that can be used to examine how facets of biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and biological invasions change from local to biogeographical scales. I am compiling a database of forest plots on islands across the Pacific Ocean to address these questions, in collaboration with Holger Kreft (U.</description>

      <description>I am a plant ecologist interested in temporal and spatial patterns of biodiversity change and its implications. I am particularly fascinated by the role of biodiversity in driving the capacity of ecosystems to resist and recover from global change drivers, such as land-use change, biological invasions, and fertilization. I examine these topics using experimental and observational studies and synthesis, focusing on the following questions:
i) How do biodiversity and biodiversity-dependent ecosystem functions vary across temporal and spatial scales?</description>
