# Academic website of Dylan Craven
Built using the Hugo theme and 'blogdown', following the [nice tutorial](https://www.dsquintana.blog/free-website-in-r-easy/) by Dan S. Quintana. The main  
modification that I did was to the Publications page. I continue to work on improving the aesthetics of the site. Suggestions are welcome!
