# Academic website of Dylan Craven
Built using the Hugo theme and 'blogdown', following the [nice tutorial](https://www.dsquintana.blog/free-website-in-r-easy/) by Dan S. Quintana. The main  
modification that I did was to the Publications page, which I built in RMarkdown because it  
can render bibliographies via .bib files. Now I need to work on how to better position pictures  
and adding some color.
