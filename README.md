# Academic website of Dylan Craven
Built using the Hugo theme and 'blogdown', following the [nice tutorial](https://www.dsquintana.blog/free-website-in-r-easy/) by Dan S. Quintana. The main  
modification that I did was to the Publications page, which I built in RMarkdown because it  
renders bibliographies via .bib files that are exported by Zotero. I'm working on how to arrange the
bibliography chronologically, not alphabetically, and - in general - on improving the aesthetics 
of the site.
